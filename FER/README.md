# Facial Expression Recognition (FER)
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a technology endeavour to detect a personâ€™s expressions by analysing static image or video,
today this is achieved predominantly using artificial intelligence with various potential use cases in education, public-safety,
crime detection,  market research , personalised cars, engaging video games and many more.  Over the last few years this has been 
very active research subject in deep learning with promising results in the controlled environment,  however yet there are significant
challenges in detecting emotions in the real life uncontrolled environment.  This study aimed to analyse the current progress and challenges in facial expression recognition based on a systematic literature review and discusses best  practices for the data pre-processing, data preparation and data augmentation for the design and implementation of  robust Facial Expression Recognition System (FER) for the real life applications.
