# Automation Scripts for QuPath
This folder consists some of the groovy scripts to automate QuPath class creation , export annotations to file and import annotations back to the project. 
They could be helpful if you work annotating image files in QuPath. 

Simply open scripts in the QuPath script editor and run them, please feel free to contact me if you need any support.
