### Datasets
<ul>
<li>
<h3> ImageNet</h3>
Imagenet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. The project has been instrumental in advancing computer vision and deep learning research. The data is available for free to researchers for non-commercial use.\\

<li> <h3> COCO</h3> COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. Download URL https://cocodataset.org/#download</li>
 <li> <h3>VQA </h3>VQA is a new dataset containing open-ended questions about images. These questions require an understanding of vision, language and commonsense knowledge to answer. Download URL https://visualqa.org/download.html </li>
  <li><h3>Cityscapes Dataset </h3>The Cityscapes Dataset focuses on semantic understanding of urban street scenes. In the following, we give an overview on the design choices that were made to target the datasetâ€™s focus. Download URL https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/login/ </li>
  <li><h3>VCR Data Set </h3>Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) is a new task and large-scale dataset for cognition-level visual understanding. Download URL  https://visualcommonsense.com/download/</li>
